# funconfigs-csgo
## A bunch of fun config files that I made to kill free time.
### Run them by typing in the CS:GO console:
`exec (name of config)`

#### Don't know how to open the console? Press ` or put -console inside your launch options. You may need to change your settings to enable the console.
